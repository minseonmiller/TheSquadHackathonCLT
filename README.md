TheSquad-Patient Portal for HackathonCLT

-->Inspiration</br>
We figured out that it is not easy for patients to get hold of their own medical data. To transfer their own data, patients have to call doctors offices to offices. Not to mention filling out the same (also very time consuming) patient form every time they visit the new doctors' office.

In addition to this, we thought of how difficult it is to find a doctor who accepts certain insurance or even take patients without insurance.

So we've decided to focus on a patient portal where we can provide multiple solutions to patients from one place.

-->What it does</br>
A. The patient portal gives access to the patient's medical history. So that the patient can take preventive action. B. The patient portal allows patients without insurance to find doctors who would accept them - Patient portal doctor rating system is based on the patient's answers on questions. Such as "Which insurance did this doctor take?" "How long was the service waiting time?" "How much co-pay did you pay for your service?" "Which service did you receive?" C.The patient can type in patient form once for all, and whenever they need to see a new doctor, they can simply send the file to the doctor's office.
